# Timstock-Slim
Repository for schematic, code and extras for Timstock Slim

For those of you who don't know what a Timstock is and how to use it? Here is a quick description.

The Timstock tool is a device for visually, and auditory, show the user progression of time, in 4 different increments/fixed times.

The most common configuration is 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, and each button has its own colour. When you press one of the buttons the time starts to count down until 0, when a visual and optional auditory alarm is displayed.

Autistic people, and especially kids, often lack concept of time - which makes it really hard to grasp what "do this for 10 minutes" means. Each lesson in school is planned prior to class begins and the child gets one or more tasks on a taskboard with pictograms or similar to show what the task is, and often each task is also tied to time. The youngest see this as do something yellow and the something else green, where colours indicate which button to press on the Timstock. Later on they start to learn what number to press on the Timstock instead of the colour, but it is always good to make it as simple to understand as possible.

The downside with a classic Timstock is that you need to have more than one if you need e.g. 10, 20, 30 and 40 minute timer as well as the usual 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. This will be configurable on the Timstock Slim by long pressing on certain buttons.

It is not possible (well, it is but you don't teach the kids how to) stop or pause a countdown when it has started, otherwise they would quickly "extend" a timed break or similar... ;) (I know my kids too well and they would've done that as soon as someone looked away...)

It is very important for most autistic kids to have a clear definition of start and stop of every task since they struggle with what time really is and by matching each task with a number, or a colour, they learn to rely on their Timstock so that they never miss an activity or wonder how long they are going to do it? The countdown is visually counting down by leds turning off according to how many minutes are left, and such a simple tool can make a BIG difference! A shame it often cost more than $200 each...

My goal was to make it for under $15, or the price of a pizza. That should be affordable in one way or another for everyone regardless of financial situation - and if you have the skills and means, you can make your own copy 100% free!

There is decades of studies how to use a Timstock so I'm not inventing a new methodology or concept - I'm just making it better, cheaper and more available to whoever need it. It will also not look like a "handicap aid" and this turned out to be an important factor in my usability studies.

If you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer them! I don't want to make any profit from this. I want it to be available to everyone who needs it.
